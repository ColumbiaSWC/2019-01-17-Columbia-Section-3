## Setup / Check-In

Did you follow the [Setup instructions](https://columbiaswc.github.io/2019-01-17-Columbia-Section-3/#setup) for your Operating System in advance? I sure hope so!

If you did, let's check your system.

1. Open your terminal/shell.
2. Type `nano --version` and hit enter to check nano.
3. Type `git --version` and hit enter to check git.
4. Type `jupyter --version` and hit enter to check jupyter.
5. Type `python --version` and hit enter to check python.

Next, download the [demo data and bootcamp guides]({{ site.baseurl }}/swc-materials.zip). Unzip the file and move the resulting folder `swc-materials` onto your Desktop.

Included will be `bash.md` to help you follow along in the Bash section, `python.ipynb` for the Python section, and `git.md` for the Git section.
